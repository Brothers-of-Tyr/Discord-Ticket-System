# Ticket-Bot
A discord ticket system with PostgresQL

# Information
This is not supposed to be a copy and paste exercise, if you want to recreate the system, learn the python basics first. 

If you have any improvement suggestions feel free to contact me.

### For beginners of discord.py!

If you are completly new to discord.py or generally python - DO NOT JUST copy the code - study the syntax first and try slightly easier projects. 

# Requirements

- Python 3.8.6 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/))
- discord.py (pip install -U discord.py[voice]) (Tested with version 1.6.0)
- PostgresSQL Database (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (or anything similar)
- pip install asyncpg

# How to create the same bot for your server
1. Go on the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and make a new application. Now create a new bot and add him to your server.

2. Create a database named ``PostgresSQL-Tickets`` and add two tables.  

3. Name the first table ``tickets`` and the second one ``requests``. 

4. Add two columns (guild_id and ticket_id) to the [tickets-table](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771635939700768769/827459057223860254/unknown.png). Make sure that ``guild_id`` is a primary key.

5. Add three columns (guild_id, channel_name and channel_id) to the [requests-table](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771635939700768769/827459186870190100/unknown.png). **We do not need a primary key here!**

6. Start the bot and type ``?ticket`` in your ticket-channel. A message like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771635939700768769/827460503185653790/unknown.png) should pop up.

7. Now copy the ID of your server and the message you just created and fill it in the database. Your DB should look like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771635939700768769/827460984628183060/unknown.png).

8. If you want to edit the embed-message open ``ticket.py``.

9. If you are done you can restart the bot and click on the ðŸ“©. You should see a new channel with a [message](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771635939700768769/827462375803191326/unknown.png) inside.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```python
@commands.command()
@commands.has_permissions(administrator=True)
async def ticket(self, ctx):

    embed = discord.Embed(
        title="Would you like to create a ticket?", 
        description="If you have any questions or concerns create a new ticket by clicking on the emoji below this message.", 
        color=0xf7fcfd)

    embed.add_field(name="Do you want to report someone?", value="Please contact a supporter or moderator directly!", inline=True)
    embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771635939700768769/773121323341578250/external-content.duckduckgo.com.png")
    embed.set_author(name="TiLiKas-Tickets")

    msg = await ctx.send(embed=embed)
    await msg.add_reaction("ðŸ“©")
```
**I would recommend to change the authors-name (TiLiKas-Tickets)**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you have three diffrent emoji choices:

âœ… -> Claim the ticket (*The creator of the ticket cant claim it*)

â›” -> Mention every supporter (Does not do anything right now - I'm at it right now!)

ðŸ”’ -> Close the ticket - the channel will be delete after 10 seconds and send a message in the ``ticket-log`` channel.

# Done

If you did everything correctly your bot should work like in the examples!

I will not reply to basic questions like "How can I start my bot" or if the error message clearly states what is not working. 
As I wrote at the beginning, this tutorial is not for complete beginners.
